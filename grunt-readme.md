# **Basic Starter SCSS template** 

------------------------------------

### **STEPS**

- Run the following command -> `npm install`

- After the packages are installed, you need to run the following command -> `grunt build`

   - With this command the project's assets are built by using the files in resources (css, scss, js, images)

- Before developing, open the `grunt-settings.js` and change the `proxy` and `host` name according to your virtual host name 

- When developing, run the default command `grunt`
 
   - With this command you activate the watcher and browsersync
   
   - The files that are watched are: `JS`, `SCSS` and `IMAGES`

- You can **add and remove** scss files from the `resources/scss` directory as needed (the ones below are the most common used)

- Make changes **ONLY** to the resources directory

- If you need to upload it to server, add the php files and the assets directory only

**Note:** If you want to use **source maps** while developing, open `includes/head.php` and change `main.min.css` to `main.css`. Don't forget to change it back when you are done.

**Source Map**: File that maps the transformed source (`main.css`) to the original source (`app.scss`) enabling the browser to reconstruct the original source. 

This means that when you open dev tools, instead of seeing the class being in `main.css`, you will see in precisely which `scss` file it is located. 

This **doesn't** work on minified css, so unless you change `main.min.css` to `main.css` you won't be able to use it.  

**Note: If you need to use external stylesheets, add them in the `css` directory inside resources and run `grunt build`. When the build is done, run `grunt` and continue developing. The external stylesheets will be copied to `assets/css` and you can use them from there.**

**Note: If you need to use external js plugins, add the `js` files to `resources/js`. They will be copied to `assets/js`.**

### **Includes**

- `assets` directory (it will be filled when you run `grunt build`)

    - `fonts/fontawesome`

- `includes` directory 

    - `footer.php` - the code for the footer (this should be the same for every page)
    
    - `head.php` - the code for the head (this is where the stylesheets and fonts are included)
    
    - `header.php` - the code for the header (this should be the same for every page)
    
    - `scripts.php` - this is where the scripts are included (an empty js is already added)

- `partials` directory 

    - this directory should be added if you use partials. It should be used if you have sections that are repeated throughout the design 

- `resources` directory

    - `css` directory (this is where the external stylesheets need to be placed)

    - `scss` directory
    
    - `js` directory
      
         - `app.js`  
    
    - `images` directory

- `grunt-settings.js`

- `Gruntfile.js`

- `app.scss` (all of the above files are imported into `app.scss` and `app.scss` is the source for the generated css file)


### **grunt-settings.js**

____________________________________

- Includes the paths for the source directories and destination directories for the tasks in `Gruntfile.js`

- You need to change the `proxy` and `host` according to the virtual host of your project


### **Gruntfile.js**
------------------------------------

##### **Contains**

- task for building the assets directory - run `grunt build`

- task for activating the watcher and browsersync - run `grunt`

- task for preparing for distribution - run `grunt dist` 

**Note:** If you run `grunt dist`, and then need to make more changes, run `grunt build`, `grunt` and when you are done, `grunt dist`
   
   - Running `grunt build` is a must, so the original css will overwrite the purged css before you start making new changes     

### grunt build

1. compile scss to css and write it to `resources/css-dev/` and `assets/css/`

1. combine media queries at the end of the file 

1. create source maps and write it to `resources/css-dev/` and `assets/css/`

1. minify the css file and write it to `resources/css-dev/` and `assets/css/`

1. run babel for the `app.js` file (convert js to a format recognizable by old browsers)

1. minify all the `.js` files from `resources/js/` and copy them in `assets/js` with `.min.js` extension

1. optimize images from `resources/images/` and write them in `assets/images/`

1. copy external css from `resources/css/` to `assets/css/`

### grunt

1. activate watcher - watch for changes in resources directory (images, js, scss, css) and php files in project

    - if new image is added in `resources/images/`, it automatically copies it to `assets/images/` - without optimization
    
    - if new js files are added in `resources/js/`, it automatically copies it to `assets/js/`
    
    **Note: if new css files are added in `resources/css/`, it doesn't copy it automatically, you need to run `grunt build`**

1. activate browsersync - your browser will be updated with every change you make in `.php` files and in resources directory - images, js, css

### grunt dist

1. remove source maps from `assets/css/`

1. optimize images from `resources/images` and copy them in `assets/images/`

1. compile scss to css and write it to `resources/css-dev/` and `assets/css/`
   
1. combine media queries at the end of the file

1. remove unused classes - purge the css and overwrite the css in `assets/css/` with the purged one 

1. minify the purged css and overwrite the `assets/css/main.min.css`

1. run babel for the `app.js` file (convert js to a format recognizable by old browsers)

1. minify all the `.js` files from `resources/js/` and copy them in `assets/js` with `.min.js` extension

1. copy external css from `resources/css/` to `assets/css/`

____________________________________________

The output will be written in assets directory 

- `assets/images/` 

- `assets/js/` 

- `assets/css/`
